				<p><strong>ParkIt</strong> is a mobile app that provides valet parking service at UC San Diego. It saves time for people in a rush or people who do not want any frustration when searching for a parking spot.<p>
				<br>
				<p>ParkIt was designed along with team RockIt in Cognitive Science course at UC San Diego. My team and I conducted interviews and user testings while creating personas, storyboards, and low to high fidelity prototypes.<p>
				<br>
				<h2>User Research</h2>
				<p>My team spent a great amount of time to discuss our needs. After discussion, we came out with valet parking service at UCSD. By analyzing the pros and cons of this idea, we finally agreed to work on valet parking app.<p>
				<br>
				<p>In order to figure out our real needs and personas, we went out to interview different groups of audience. With our interview guideline, we conducted interviews with UCSD students, faculty members, visitors, and professors. We asked questions that do not simply ask for "yes" or "no" answer to participants. With questions such as “How would you describe your experience with UCSD parking system? Why?”, we found that all these people had the same frustration when finding a parking spot.</p>
				<br>

						<h2>Personas</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>The next step was to create personas based on our interview results. We could find the pattern from the interviews and this helped us to represent our target users.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Each persona is distinct and memorable. If we say one of the name of our personas, we can recall that person and able to represent him/her. Since we created our personas, now we can apply them to the user-center design process and begin to ask a question such as “Kristy would love to use this feature, but would Alan use this?”</p>

						<h2>Storyboards</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>The story begins with the user encountering the incident. The user struggles and ends up using the valet parking app. Our storyboards are based on the personas. We discussed each persona’s personalities and behaviors and imagined what kind of conflict would they encounter.</p>

						<h2>Low-Fi Prototype</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>In order to create a prototype that is user-friendly, my group spent a great amount of time to go through each step. We visualized how an actual user will go through the app. The team agreed that the service would start with the user requesting a valet, the user would drop their car off at the valet driver’s location, and would be able to request their parked car at a later time.</p>

					<h2>User Testing and Evaluation</h2>
					<img src="images/parkit/team.png" title="Low-Fi prototype" alt="" />
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>To validate our UX, we conducted a user testing. Before we start the testing, we ordered them to say their thoughts as they go through. We allowed the participant to “click” the button as he/she goes through the app, dispensing the correct screen as they progressed. After the conduction, we asked several questions to check how the participants felt about our app.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>Based on this evaluation, we could make a design decision and give a shot for the final prototype. Here are just some of the final design changes we ended up making to our prototype, along with the affected usability heuristic and reasoning behind the design change.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h2>High-Fi Prototype</h2>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>After final user testing, our team decided how to implement the revisions of our design.</p>
					</div>
					<img src="images/parkit/color.png" title="Low-Fi prototype" alt="" />
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>Then we all started to design final screens by using Adobe Illustrator and SketchApp. For the best quality of our prototype, we used InVision app. This allowed us to make a smooth and high-quality prototype for our project. It was more powerful and user-friendly tool than Balsamiq which we used for the low-fidelity prototype.</p>
					</div>
					<img src="images/parkit/final.png" title="Low-Fi prototype" alt="" />
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>Satisfied with our resultant prototype, Team RockIt is ready to blast off with the ParkIt valet service. In an effort to eradicate extensive parking fees and general inconvenience, Team RockIt aims to facilitate the day-to-day livelihoods of its clients, trapped in an otherwise unwinnable scenario.</p>
