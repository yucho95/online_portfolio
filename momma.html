				<!--Background-->
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>The client started the steamed bun vendor business because she loved her mom’s buns and thought that it was so tasty that it should be shared with others. She came up with the idea of selling the bun which happened to coincide with the Starbucks Unicorn drink marketing campaign which she used to her advantage in creating a unique “unicorn” steamed bun that people loved. </p>
				<br>
				<!--Business Model-->
				<h2>Business Model</h2>
				<p>1. <strong>Cute</strong>: The bun itself is very cute and Momma Fung wants to provide customers a “cute experience.” </p>
				<p>2. <strong>Modest</strong>: The website should show off the buns as an experience that is humbling but also exciting to want to try and come back to. The key here is to create an experience that the users can relate to and want to return to.</p>
				<p>3. <strong>Thankful</strong>: The website should show the dedication and appreciation that we have to those that buy and eat our buns</p>
				<br>

				<!--takeaways-->
				<p>We analyzed our 5 competitors with 6 categories: branding, functinoality, content, site architecture, design, and navigation. Based on the analysis, we found some good ideas that we could use for our website. The bottom is the takeaways from the competitive analysis.</p>

				<!--Personas-->
				<h2>Personas</h2>
				<p>We conducted total 9 interviews and compiled interview data into three personas: the Foodtographer, the Just-Eater and the Picky Person. From the interview, we could find some useful patterns from potential customers. We analyzed this data to come up with several user scenarios and use cases, which will eventually be the good sources for main functions or features in website.</p>

				<h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
				<img src="images/bun/low.png" class="blackshadow low" style="max-width: 100%;">
				<p>For the low sketch prototype, I rapidly drew key pages and menu for the website. The paper prototype helped our team to have better ideas on wireframe and move on to higher fidelity prototype. </p>

				<!--Final-->
				<h2>Final Prototype</h2>
				<p>In discussion with our clients, our priorities remained mostly the same with a small changes. We were prompted by Momma Fung to design and create a functional, responsive website that conveyed the Momma Fung brand (in its colors, content, and tone of voice) that had emphasized catering as well as include a schedule of events and menu that would be accessible for all visitors and customers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For our creative vision, we maintained the Momma Fung branding by using the colors but used it strategically and sparsely to still maintain a degree of professionalism and minimalism that would otherwise deter potential, older customers who are not too fond of the bright vibrant colors. For our top user needs, we emphasized the social “instagrammable” aspect of Momma Fung through professionally-taken photos, the interactivity of seeing how the buns are made both on the home page and on the our story page, and lastly the “Foods n’ Fans” image gallery that features our fans with our buns.</p>
